				It’s no secret that the world has embraced all things digital since the birth of the internet.<br> Now we’re going to talk about how many people are online worldwide, <br>and find out how those people are spending their time online. And finally, you’ll learn how your business can benefit <br>from the still-booming digital trend.<br>

To give you an idea of the explosion of online usage over the last 15 years, consider this: In 2000, about 361 million people <br>were online worldwide. In 2016, there were over 3 billion. That’s a growth rate of 764%! Today, nearly half the world is online.</p><br>

<p>In India, the numbers are growing at an impressive rate with over 34.8% Indians having Internet access in 2016.<br> Indians are so connected that they have an average of 0.80 mobile subscriptions each, that’s nearly one mobile line per person!<br>
No matter which device they use, on average, people spend over 3 hours per day which is more than 90 hours in a month!<br>

So what are they doing with all that time online? And how can your business tap into this opportunity?</p>

<p>Many of these digitally connected people are shopping. Studies say that, there would be close to 100 million online <br>shoppers in India by the end of 2016.


Online video has also seen double-digit growth in the last five years,<br> with millions everyday watching video on social sites or via websites such as YouTube, Netflix, etc.<br>

And people are spending hours, socializing and sharing—nearly 2 and a half hours of their time spent online per day is on social media sites.<br>
If you’re a business owner, all these people doing all these things online presents loads of potential for you.</p><br>

<p>And as time goes on, people will continue to use the Internet in even more ways that will impact your business.<br>
